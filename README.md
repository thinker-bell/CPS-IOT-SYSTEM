# CPS-IOT-SYSTEM

## Introduction
The code presented in this repository provides the neccesary frameworks that are required to setup an IoT system, with a Master and Client format. The implementation is exclusively Python based. In this case the IoT system was setup to implmenet CPS security and a series of flood attacks. 

## System Requirements
The IoT system is designed to operate on two Raspberry Pi devices respectively, a Client and a Server. The Client in this case is equipped with an Arduino sensor that takes real time temperature measurements and sents it to the Server. The implementation is given via two transmission protocols, MQTT and ZeroMQ respectively.
